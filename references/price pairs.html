exchange. Two specific examples of trading pairs are bitcoin/litecoin (BTC/LTC) and ether/bitcoin cash (ETH/BCH). There are two main reasons for investors to understand trading pairs: Some cryptocurrencies can only be bought with other cryptocurrencies, so knowledge of cryptocurrency pairs is necessary to expand your crypto holdings beyond the most common coins. And, knowledge of crypto trading pairs gives savvy crypto investors the chance to exploit arbitrage opportunities — i.e., to profit from differences in asset prices between markets.</span></p></div><div id="tableOfContents"><h4 class="sc-1379d271-0 bpQUDK">Contents</h4><ul><li class="sc-9ed7d608-8 cKfwVY"><a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-are-cryptocurrency-pairs#section-how-do-crypto-trading-pairs-work" class="sc-acf3c9b3-7 bOKKsO"><p color="black" class="sc-1379d271-0 kdhPvK">How Do Crypto Trading Pairs Work?</p></a></li><li class="sc-9ed7d608-8 cKfwVY"><a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-are-cryptocurrency-pairs#section-what-is-a-base-currency-and-why-is-it-important" class="sc-acf3c9b3-7 bOKKsO"><p color="black" class="sc-1379d271-0 kdhPvK">What Is a Base Currency and Why Is It Important?</p></a></li><li class="sc-9ed7d608-8 cKfwVY"><a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-are-cryptocurrency-pairs#section-which-cryptocurrency-pairs-aid-in-arbitrage-opportunities" class="sc-acf3c9b3-7 bOKKsO"><p color="black" class="sc-1379d271-0 kdhPvK">Which Cryptocurrency Pairs Aid in Arbitrage Opportunities?</p></a></li></ul></div><div class="sc-9ed7d608-1 lgayrS"><h2 id="section-how-do-crypto-trading-pairs-work" class="sc-acf3c9b3-1 eUPspr"><span>How Do Crypto Trading Pairs Work?</span></h2><p class="sc-1379d271-0 jEBLlH"><span></span><span class="sc-2f4cebfe-1 hOVocu"><a router="[object Object]" class="sc-9ed7d608-6 jUcywW" href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/glossary#cryptocurrency-pair-trading-pair"><span class="sc-2a8d2050-0 PsqtZ">Cryptocurrency pairs</span></a></span><span> allow you to compare costs between different </span><a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/cryptocurrencies-vs-tokens-difference#section-what-is-a-cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="sc-2f4cebfe-0 hrIPdK"><span class="sc-2a8d2050-0 PsqtZ">cryptocurrencies</span></a><span>.
